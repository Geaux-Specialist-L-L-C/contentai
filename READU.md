This project aims to create a scalable and modular platform to generate K-12 educational content, including text, visuals, and audio. The platform leverages advanced language models, image generation models, and speech synthesis to produce high-quality, curriculum-aligned material for students and educators.

## Features
- **Text Content Generation**: Using GPT-based models to create lessons, quizzes, and summaries.
- **Visual Content Generation**: Leveraging Stable Diffusion for diagrams and illustrations.
- **Audio Content Generation**: Using Tacotron or FastSpeech for natural speech synthesis.
- **Cloud Integration**: AWS, Azure, and Snowflake for storage, deployment, and data management.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Powered by Docker and Porter for robust, containerized deployment.

This file provides GitHub Copilot with context about the repository's purpose, structure, and guidelines. It helps Copilot generate more accurate and relevant code suggestions.

Repository Purpose
The goal of this project is to generate curriculum-aligned educational content for K-12 students using AI models. It includes:

Text-based lessons and assessments using language models.
Visual content (e.g., diagrams) using diffusion-based models.
Audio content (e.g., narrated lessons) using speech synthesis.
Key Features
Fine-tuning pre-trained models (e.g., GPT, Stable Diffusion, Tacotron).
Scalable deployment via Docker, Porter, AWS, and Azure.
Cloud-based data storage and processing using Snowflake.
