# Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the next steps for the development of the K-12 Educational Platform. The project consists of a frontend, backend, and MongoDB database, all running in Docker containers.

## Current Status
- **Frontend**: Running at `http://localhost:4173/`
- **Backend**: Running at `http://0.0.0.0:8000`
- **MongoDB**: Running on `port 27017`

## Next Steps

### 1. Verify Frontend-Backend Integration
- Ensure that the frontend can successfully communicate with the backend.
- Test API calls from the frontend to the backend.

### 2. Implement Authentication
- Add user authentication to the backend using JWT or OAuth.
- Create login and registration pages in the frontend.

### 3. Develop Key Features
- **Content Management**: Implement CRUD operations for educational content.
- **User Management**: Implement user roles and permissions.
- **Analytics**: Add analytics to track user progress and content usage.

### 4. Write Unit Tests
- Write unit tests for the backend using `pytest`.
- Write unit tests for the frontend using a testing framework like `Jest`.

### 5. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- Automate testing and deployment processes.

### 6. Documentation
- Document API endpoints using Swagger or another API documentation tool.
- Write user guides and developer documentation.

### 7. Performance Optimization
- Optimize database queries and indexing.
- Implement caching strategies to improve performance.

### 8. Security Enhancements
- Implement input validation and sanitization.
- Ensure secure communication between services using HTTPS.

### 9. Deployment
- Deploy the application to a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Set up monitoring and logging for the deployed application.

## Detailed Tasks

### Verify Frontend-Backend Integration
1. Test API calls from the frontend to the backend.
2. Debug and fix any issues with API communication.

### Implement Authentication
1. Add JWT or OAuth authentication to the backend.
2. Create login and registration endpoints in the backend.
3. Develop login and registration pages in the frontend.
4. Implement session management in the frontend.

### Develop Key Features
1. **Content Management**:
   - Create endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting content.
   - Develop frontend components for managing content.
2. **User Management**:
   - Implement user roles and permissions in the backend.
   - Develop frontend components for managing users.
3. **Analytics**:
   - Add endpoints for tracking user progress and content usage.
   - Develop frontend components for displaying analytics.

### Write Unit Tests
1. Write unit tests for backend endpoints using `pytest`.
2. Write unit tests for frontend components using `Jest`.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
1. Set up GitHub Actions for running tests on push and pull requests.
2. Automate the build and deployment process.

### Documentation
1. Document API endpoints using Swagger or another tool.
2. Write user guides for using the application.
3. Write developer documentation for contributing to the project.

### Performance Optimization
1. Optimize database queries and indexing.
2. Implement caching strategies to reduce load times.

### Security Enhancements
1. Implement input validation and sanitization.
2. Ensure secure communication between services using HTTPS.

### Deployment
