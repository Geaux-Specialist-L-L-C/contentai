# K-12 Educational Content Generator

This project aims to create a scalable and modular platform to generate K-12 educational content, including text, visuals, and audio. The platform leverages advanced language models, image generation models, and speech synthesis to produce high-quality, curriculum-aligned material for students and educators.

## Features
- **Text Content Generation**: Using GPT-based models to create lessons, quizzes, and summaries.
- **Visual Content Generation**: Leveraging Stable Diffusion for diagrams and illustrations.
- **Audio Content Generation**: Using Tacotron or FastSpeech for natural speech synthesis.
- **Cloud Integration**: AWS, Azure, and Snowflake for storage, deployment, and data management.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Powered by Docker and Porter for robust, containerized deployment.
