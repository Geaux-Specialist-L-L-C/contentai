# K-12 Educational Content Generator

This project aims to create a scalable and modular platform to generate K-12 educational content, including text, visuals, and audio. The platform leverages advanced language models, image generation models, and speech synthesis to produce high-quality, curriculum-aligned material for students and educators.

## Features
- **Text Content Generation**: Using GPT-based models to create lessons, quizzes, and summaries.
- **Visual Content Generation**: Leveraging Stable Diffusion for diagrams and illustrations.
- **Audio Content Generation**: Using Tacotron or FastSpeech for natural speech synthesis.
- **Cloud Integration**: AWS, Azure, and Snowflake for storage, deployment, and data management.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Powered by Docker and Porter for robust, containerized deployment.

# Copilot Context for K-12 Educational Content Generator

This file provides GitHub Copilot with context about the repository's purpose, structure, and guidelines. It helps Copilot generate more accurate and relevant code suggestions.

## Repository Purpose
The goal of this project is to generate curriculum-aligned educational content for K-12 students using AI models. It includes:
- Text-based lessons and assessments using language models.
- Visual content (e.g., diagrams) using diffusion-based models.
- Audio content (e.g., narrated lessons) using speech synthesis.

## Key Features
- Fine-tuning pre-trained models (e.g., GPT, Stable Diffusion, Tacotron).
- Scalable deployment via Docker, Porter, AWS, and Azure.
- Cloud-based data storage and processing using Snowflake.

### **`DATA_GUIDE.md`**

```markdown
# Data Handling and Preprocessing Guide

This guide explains how to manage, preprocess, and store data for the K-12 Educational Content Generator project.

## Types of Data
1. **Text Data**:
   - Lessons, quizzes, and educational content in plain text or JSON format.
   - Source: Publicly available K-12 textbooks, online resources.

2. **Visual Data**:
   - Diagrams, illustrations, and educational images in PNG or JPEG format.
   - Source: Open-source educational image libraries.

3. **Audio Data**:
   - Narrated lessons or pronunciation guides in WAV or MP3 format.
   - Source: Recorded lectures or synthetic speech datasets.

## Data Preprocessing
### Text Data
- Tokenize text using `transformers` library:
  ```python
  from transformers import AutoTokenizer
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt-3")
  tokens = tokenizer("Example text", return_tensors="pt")
Visual Data
Resize images for Stable Diffusion using Pillow:
python
Copy code
from PIL import Image
img = Image.open("image.png").resize((512, 512))
img.save("image_resized.png")
Audio Data
Convert audio files to a uniform format using pydub:
python
Copy code
from pydub import AudioSegment
audio = AudioSegment.from_file("file.mp3")
audio.export("file.wav", format="wav")
Storage
AWS S3: Use for large datasets and backups.
Azure Blob Storage: Alternative cloud storage for structured data.
Snowflake: For scalable analytics and pre-processing.
Refer to src/data/preprocess.py for detailed scripts.
